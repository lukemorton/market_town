Checkout logic for your online store. With Spree, Solidus and webhook integrations.

MarketTown::Checkout provides ruby code that you can call from your Rails controllers or Sinatra block. It provides logic for handling all the steps you might want in a checkout, leaving it up to you to stitch them together whilst giving sensible defaults.

If you've ever wanted to gradually replace Spree/Solidus with your own system, or split your e-commerce app out into a number of different services then you're in the right place.

##Â Mission

 - Handle common use cases of checkout step behaviour including:
    - Cart
    - Address
    - Delivery
    - Payment
    - Complete
 - Provide a Spree integration for writing your own checkout controllers and
   flows that speak to Spree objects underneath
 - Provide a Webhook integration that will forward calls onto a HTTPS
   interface of your choice
